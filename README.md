# Random-Quote-Generator

This project is a simple web application that generates random quotes along with their respective authors. It consists of an HTML file, a CSS file , and a JavaScript file. The purpose of the project is to provide users with inspirational or thought-provoking quotes each time they click a button labeled "New Quote".

Here's a detailed description of the project:

HTML Structure:

The HTML file (index.html) provides the basic structure of the web page.
It contains a header section with the title "Quote Generator" and a main content section.
Within the main content section, there is a container element that holds the quote, the author's name, and a button labeled "New Quote".

CSS Styling:

The CSS file defines styles for various elements on the web page, including fonts, colors, layout, and button appearance.
It ensures the visual appeal of the project by setting backgrounds, borders, margins, and padding to create a visually cohesive design.

JavaScript Functionality:

The JavaScript file (project_1.js) handles the dynamic behavior of the application.
It defines an array of objects named quotes, with each object containing a quote and its corresponding author.
It selects the button element with the ID "new-quote" and adds an event listener to it.
When the "New Quote" button is clicked, a random quote is selected from the quotes array.
The selected quote and its author are then displayed on the webpage by updating the text content of the respective HTML elements.

User Interaction:

Users interact with the application by clicking the "New Quote" button to generate a new random quote.
With each click, a different quote along with its author is displayed on the webpage, providing users with fresh inspiration or insight.
